**Makes sure your content looks great on all social and search sites - no matter how webpage URLs are crawled, shared, re-shared, posted, or embedded:**

WPSSO Core and its complementary add-ons are provide comprehensive information about your webpage content to social sites (Facebook, Pinterest, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.), search engines and crawlers (Google, Bing, etc.), mail and text messaging apps (Facebook Messenger, iMessage, Skype, WhatsApp, etc.), REST API clients, and oEmbed data for embedded objects / iframes (LinkedIn, WordPress, etc.) &mdash; all from your existing WordPress content and plugin data.

No other meta tag or Schema plugin satisfies all these essential social and search markup standards.

**Uses your pre-existing WordPress content and plugin / API data:**

There's no need to manually duplicate or re-enter descriptions, titles, product information, re-select images / videos, etc. WPSSO reads your existing post, page, product, media, recipe, event, forum, and SEO content automatically &mdash; while also offering fine-tuning and customization options for just about everything. ;-)

**Creates complete and accurate meta tags and Schema markup:**

WPSSO Core and its complementary add-ons create meta tags and Schema markup for Facebook / Open Graph, Google's Knowledge Graph, Google Rich Results with Structured Data, Mobile Web Browsers, oEmbed data for LinkedIn, Pinterest Rich Pins, Twitter Cards, Weibo and many more &mdash; including complete markup for image SEO, video SEO, extensive e-Commerce product markup (for WooCommerce and others), mobile apps, author profile / authorship, co-authors, publisher information, local business markup, aggregate ratings, reviews, recipe information, event details, and much, much more &mdash; all from your existing WordPress content and plugin data!

WPSSO Core is language / locale aware, which means you can customize your site information, social page URLs and Knowledge Graph information for different languages.

**Includes quality assurance features and options:**

* Checks for minimum / maximum image dimensions and aspect ratios.
* Shows notices for missing and required images.
* Verifies webpages for duplicate meta tags.
* Validates theme header templates for correct HTML markup.
* Checks and warns of any missing PHP modules.
* Checks 3rd party plugin settings for possible conflicts.

**Coded for maximum performance:**

WPSSO Core makes full use of all available caching methods &mdash; along with offering advanced caching features like pre-seeding its cache in background. WPSSO Core and its complementary add-ons only load the libraries and classes they need, keeping their code small, fast and light. All code is fully tested and compatible with the latest version of WordPress and PHP v7.x (PHP v5.5 or newer required).

&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605; &mdash; "This plugin saves me so much time, and it has really lifted my SERP rankings. Most of my keywords I now rank 1-3 position. I also noticed after about a week that my impressions have gone up at least 75%. I upgraded to the pro version which gave me even more options." - [playnstocks](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/excellent-plugin-and-support-200/)

&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605; &mdash; "Yoast on steroids! As an SEO marketer, I love using Yoast for my basic on-page SEO. But Yoast only allows you to enter basic Open Graph social settings. This plugin gives you SO many more options on completing the Open Graph for Facebook, Twitter cards, Pinterest etc. If you use WordPress, I totally recommend using this plugin to help with better rankings in the SERPS!" - [gregmontag](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/yoast-on-steroids/)

<h3 class="top">Release Schedule</h3>

<p>New versions of the plugin are released approximately every week (more or less). New features are added, tested, and released incrementally, instead of grouping them together in a major version release. When minor bugs fixes and/or code improvements are applied, new versions are also released. This release schedule keeps the code stable and reliable, at the cost of more frequent updates.</p>

<p>See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Release_early,_release_often">release early, release often (RERO) software development philosophy</a> on Wikipedia for more information on the benefits of smaller / more frequent releases.</p>
